This keyboard is a driver-free production, It's based on a standard windows keyboard. You can just plug and play on Linux,macOS, Windows, and many platforms after setting up on a windows7(or higher version windows) PC,
There is no software installation, background, or repetitive setting up, and it will **not** be recognized as a storage device. The keyboard has a memory function. You don’t need to set it up next time. After setting, the software can be closed or deleted as you wish. One computer can be used with multiple keyboards with them set up one by one(plug one in then set up it, unplug, and plug in another one ...).The keyboard supports up to 6 keys to be pressed concurrently, the default setting is 123..., to change the key value, please refer to the following tutorial.

> Using Non-Windows System: You should set the keyboard on a **windows PC** (7 or above) first, then it can be used by plugging into a non-windows system computer. If you're using macOS or iOS, use the **"win"** key instead of the **"command"** key, and **"alt"** instead of the **"option"**.For example, the Hotkey of copy is "command + c" in macOS and iOS, then it is "win + c" when you're making settings.

# TUTORIAL

( The manual accompanying our productions is just a brief tutorial )

### Step 1

Click the link to download the zip file, and copy the zip file to D:/ (better not to put it on C:/ or Desktop )

https://github.com/TabbycatPie/CustomKeyboard/releases/tag/stable

### Step 2

Turn off anti-virus software, and unzip the file ( you need to install related software like WinRAR, and 7zip first ). Maybe your anti-virus software will alert you there is some threat because of the third-party software installation, skip it if you trust or maybe open it in a VM if you don't.

After unzipping, as shown in the picture, some people may get garbled characters, it's ok, just find the **.jpg** file and **.exe** file.

### Step 3

Plug one end of the accompanying cable into the keyboard and the other end can be directly plugged into the USB port of the computer ( better be the USB on the back side of the box, which means the port on the motherboard ), as you can see in the picture, the 3-key keyboard is plugged into the USB port of the laptop.

### Step 4

Double-click the exe file to open the software and open the key mapping picture ( we will call that "keymap" later) as well.

Assuming you bought a 3-key keyboard, you can find this icon (插图), the "KEY1" is referred to as KEY1 in the software, "KEY2" is KEY2 in the software, and so on.. simple, right? You may wonder why there are 10 keys in the software, Just forget about it, take care of these 3.

### Step 5

Assuming you want to set up a Normal key, For example, you bought a 1-key keyboard, and you want to set the action "Enter"( "return" in macOS or iOS ) to the key, first, you can find in the keymap the referring key in the software is KEY2, then click ( when we mention 'click' that means left single click ) KEY2 in the software, move your mouse away, the KEY2 in the software is still turned red meaning it is selected, and then click the Enter in the virtual-keyboard in the software as it is shown on blow picture, finally, click Download to make the keyboard aware that you make changes and it will save your configuration permanently until next click of "Download" button.



> Tips: If you want to set up single action like Ctrl, Shift, Alt, or Win, For example, single "Ctrl", you should make sure to click ADD button after clicking Ctrl on the virtual keyboard as is shown in the picture below, and then you can click Download button to make changes saved.
