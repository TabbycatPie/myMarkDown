This keyboard is a driver-free production, It's based on a standard windows keyboard. You can just plug and play on Linux,macOS, Windows, and many platforms after setting up on a windows7(or higher version windows) PC,
There is no software installation, background, or repetitive setting up, and it will **not** be recognized as a storage device. The keyboard has a memory function. You donâ€™t need to set it up next time. After setting, the software can be closed or deleted as you wish. One computer can be used with multiple keyboards with them set up one by one(plug one in then set up it, unplug, and plug in another one ...).The keyboard supports up to 6 keys to be pressed concurrently, the default setting is 123..., to change the key value, please refer to the following tutorial.

> Using Non-Windows System: You should set the keyboard on a **windows PC** (7 or above) first, then it can be used by plugging into a non-windows system computer. If you're using macOS or iOS, use the **"win"** key instead of the **"command"** key, and **"alt"** instead of the **"option"**.For example, the Hotkey of copy is "command + c" in macOS and iOS, then it is "win + c" when you're making settings.

# TUTORIAL

( The manual accompanying our productions is just a brief tutorial )

### Step 1

Click the link to download the zip file, and copy the zip file to D:/ (better not to put it on C:/ or Desktop)

### Step 2

Turn off anti-virus software, and unzip the file ( you need to install related software like WinRAR, and 7zip first ). Maybe your anti-virus software will alert you there is some threat because of the third-party software installation, skip it if you trust or maybe open it in a VM if you don't.
